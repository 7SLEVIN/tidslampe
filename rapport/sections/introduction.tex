In this assignment we have attempted to meet the requirements of the assignment, but have gone a step further by adding a persistency layer as well as a graphical user interface. We realize that these were not part of the essential assignment, but while in the initial planning and designing phase, we agreed on finding it would be easier to implement the system that way from the beginning. That is true for both the persistency and the GUI alike.

We have chosen to do so in order to gain more experience which we can use later on in our studies. *** ahhhh?

Section \ref{requirements} describes our perception of the customers wishes through a glossary and six use cases. This part is very important in real life, as it is used to align expectations between the costumer and developer.

Section \ref{architecture} is a description of the design of the application through class diagrams as well as three sequence diagrams. This part has it's real-life use amongst the actual developers working on an application, as it makes the code more manageable to the developers - especially newcomers.
