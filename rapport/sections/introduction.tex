In this assignment we have attempted to meet the specified requirements, while also meeting our own requirements namely adding a persistency layer as well as a graphical user interface.
We have chosen to do so in order to gain more experience which we can use later on in our studies.
** eller måske skrive at vi valgte at binde application layer kraftigt sammen med persistency layer, da ...? Andet argument end at vi bare synes den opgave Hubert har stillet er lame **

Section \ref{requirements} describes our perception of the costumers wishes through a glossary and six use cases.
This part is very important in real life, as it is used to align expectations between the costumer and developer.

Section \ref{architecture} is a description of the design of the application by a class diagram as well as three sequence diagrams.
This part has it's real life use amongst the actual developers working on an application, as it makes the code more manageable to the developers - especially newcomers.
