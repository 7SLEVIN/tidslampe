We have successfully designed and developed a fully working time management system. We are very pleased with the result and think that it meets the requirements given. 

We have developed most of the code (excluding the raw views) in TDD style, which has left us with a decent coverage of around 80\%, excluding the code in the \code{view.state}-package (as defined in the assignment). The majority of the remaining uncovered instructions is in the \code{controller}-package.

There is, as always, room for improvements. Specifically we should have developed more through interfaces than we did. This would make testing much easier, and will define an objects API, and hence its responsibilities, much more concisely and make the code more robust and understandable overall.

As for the original scheduled plan, we have not changed a lot during development. We changed the order in which things got developed some, but overall the plan was observed. We had to drop a few features, but they were practically not important (for instance, the calculation of the velocity of a project, or the splitting of one activity into two parts).
