We have not made very many compromises regarding the functionalities described in the specifications. We decided from the beginning to implement a GUI, but also knew that we would not be spending much time styling and visually designing it. This is somewhat reflected in the final result, even though we find it good enough to actually be useable.

We were a little confused about some of the features described. For instance, at first we thought the sentence ``Projektlederen skal gradvis opdele projektet i aktiviteter'' meant that activities should be dividable after their creation. Later on we agreed that this was not the case and dropped development of that particular feature. Also we were not excatly sure what the project report had to show or do, so we thought up a solution that met the requirements as we understood them, and seemed useful.
